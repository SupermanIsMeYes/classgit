      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        We also offer week long Whitewater Rafting trips in Colorado and Roaring
        Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. This is where we teach wilderness
        survival, food prep and spirtual resilience. Since 1974, we have been
        family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood
        Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, Latter-Day Survival can make it happen for
        you.
